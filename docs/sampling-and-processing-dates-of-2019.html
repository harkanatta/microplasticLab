<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Efficiency of digestion</h2>
<p>Samples 901-906 could not be weighed as those samples were put onto a GF/C filter which seems to have lost weight after filtration. Hence samples 901-906 could not give us information about the digestion efficiency.
Samples 907-909 were put onto a membrane filter (0.22 um) and samples 910-922 were put onto the normal Nitrocellulose filters. Weight was taken from all filters after they had been dried at room temperature for several weeks.
The median digestion efficiency was 92 % which means that 92 % of the organic matter present in the beginning was digested. The average digestion efficiency was at 88 %.
The amount left behind on the filter after digestion correlates with the amount of organic matter originally present in the samples.
Digestion efficiency was below the average in samples 915, 916, 917, 918 and 920. Possibly because of high content of diatoms.
All but the nitrocellulose filters were digestet as well which explains why digestion efficiancy is over 100% in many cases.</p>
