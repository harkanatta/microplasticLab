**Jóhann, Valtýr and Karin met at the innovation centre to try out the Raman on a few samples from Biopol. The samples were in PS petri dishes and on nitrocellulose filters**

## Challenges and observations:


* The petri dishes were too high to use a bigger magnification (only 5x could be used)
  + find a better solution, to be able to use bigger objectives (but it should be closed to be able to avoid contamination)
  + Here are [shallower petri dishes](https://www.amazon.com/Millipore-PD1504700-PetriSlide-Contamination-Analysis/dp/B07RGLQY8T)

---

* No problem to keep the samples on nitrocellulose
  + The instrument could pick up the spectrum from the filter which can be subtracted later

---  
  
* No problem to focus through the lid of the PS petri dishes (however we did not try to do a scan without the lid to see if that could have made a difference (ask the innovation centre))

---  

* focused on the lid of the petri dish and got the right match for PS
* The database expired and needs to be renewed.
  + maybe not necessary for our samples as we could create our own database with the most common plastics.
  + or ask somone else to send us the specs for the most common plastics
 
---  
 
* Run a spec from two big fibres on the filters
  + those fibres were big enough to be observed with the naked eye.
  + one fibre did not seem to be of synthetic origin as the spec was very similar to the nitrocellulose spec. (Probably some sort of cellulose)
  + the other fibre gave a good match with PP and a pigment

## Ask Marie and Enora

* What kind of tray/dish they use to out their filter on how do they do their analysis with the particle finder
  + what kind of settings?
      + only laser 785?
      + for how long? (We tried 10 sec.)
      + what kind of particle size do they detect? Only down to 335 or smaller?
      
---
      
* Will the particle finder also make a scan of all the organic material?
  + it should be all digested then?!

## Ideas of collaboration between Hafró and Biopol on MP

* Biopol is well equipped with regards to MP sampling, digestion and preparation of samples
* Biopol lacks a good analytical instrument (Raman)
* Lack of aim
    + what do we want to see or prove?
    + sampling locations?
    + particle size (sampling method, Nishkin/Manta/plankton net)?
    + sampling matrix (biota/sediment/water)?
  
---
  
* Hafró could help with analysis of the sample by Raman
* Hafró could assist with ideas about the aim of the study
    + do we want to publish a report on sample processing or report on MP in Icelandic waters?
    + do we need to apply for funding?

---

* Jóhann is trying to involve another person (Lisa) in the project who could possibly take over his work.
* Hafró has not given MP's much consideration yet but Lisa thinks it's necessary for Hafró to build a clean working environment in the new facilities to be up to standards for publishing on MP.
